 <h1>How it started!</h1>
<p>This magazine is the result of a lot of contemplation. Psi25Omega was thinking about stuff he would like to learn and read about each day when he thought, "Why not take notes and make it a document? Why not write it? It certainly would look good as well!". And then, he played with the different styles and options available for a few days and had a basic draft of the document. It was after this that he invited NSPKN6506 to the party after both of them found the project interesting to work on and helpful to people as well. And they have come this far, from struggling with multiple errors due to bad code (Yeah, they were not so good back then XD). If you feel they did well, do say a "Hi" to them in school or on Discord or anywhere you meet them (You can certainly discuss more about these things). They would love to clarify any doubts on the magazine.</p>

<h1>How you can start reading!</h1>
<p>So, now you have finished the boring Introduction and have come to the part where you get some advice on how you can start reading the magazine. The thing is, there is no defined way in which you should read this.The content is a basic gist of the topic and tries kindle your interest to go to a browser and type in the topic on the search bar.</p>

<h1>Final thoughts</h1>
<p>Here are some final thoughts and reflections on the magazine. Please forgive us for any mistakes in the magazine and we'll try to correct them whenever you guys submit a pull request or we notice it. The magazine intends to discuss topics that have great scope for research and tries to give a basic understanding of them. But don't worry, you can still understand most (95%) of the stuff (You can always use the internet to know about the things you don't understand). </p>
